# Videos & external resources (beginner-friendly)

Curated list of **current** (App Router, modern Next.js) video and interactive resources. Prefer these over older “Pages Router” or class-based React tutorials.

## Official Next.js learning (free, up to date)

- **Next.js Learn (interactive course)**  
  https://nextjs.org/learn  

  Covers React basics → App Router → data fetching, layouts, server/client components, and a full app. Start here if you are new to Next.js.

- **Next.js YouTube (Vercel)**  
  https://www.youtube.com/@Vercel  

  Look for playlists or videos titled **App Router**, **Server Actions**, or **Next.js 14/15**. Avoid very old “Pages Router” series.

---

## What to look for in any video

- **App Router** – routing with `app/` folder and `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`.
- **Server Components** – default in App Router; no `"use client"` unless needed.
- **Server Actions** – `"use server"`, form actions, mutations.
- **Next.js 14 or 15** – matches this project’s patterns.

---

## What to avoid (outdated for this project)

- Tutorials that use **Pages Router** (`pages/`, `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`) as the main approach.
- Very old React class components as the primary style (hooks are used in this repo).
- Next.js 12 or earlier as the only version shown.

## How to use this with the learning folder

1. Read `learning/README.md` and follow the recommended order.
2. Use **REFERENCES.md** for written docs (Next.js, Prisma, Zod, etc.).
3. Use **this file** for videos and interactive courses when you want to see things explained step by step.
4. Prefer **nextjs.org/learn** and recent Vercel/Next.js videos over random older tutorials.
